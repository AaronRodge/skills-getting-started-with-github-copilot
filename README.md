## How to Create and Publish a New Git Branch

1. **Create a new branch:**
    ```sh
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```

2. **Make your changes and commit them:**
    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Describe your changes"
    ```

3. **Push the branch to GitHub:**
    ```sh
    git push -u origin your-branch-name
    ```

Replace `your-branch-name` with a descriptive name for your branch.
## Quick Reference

```sh
git checkout -b {new_branch_name}
git push -u origin {new_branch_name}
```
